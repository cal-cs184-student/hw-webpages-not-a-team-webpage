		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<b>Briefly explain de Casteljau’s algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.</b><br/>
		De Casteljau’s algorithm recursively lerps between the points (based on the t value) to get the Bezier curve’s point at that given t. That is, it starts with n+1 points (where n is the order) and a t, outputting 1 point. This is very simple to implement. At each iteration, we simply store the point that is the lerp between any two adjacent points, and keep going until we only have one point left.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<b>Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.</b><br/>
		De Casteljau’s algorithm extends very simply to Bezier surfaces. For an array of n x n control points, we simply use one of the parameters to compute the Bezier point for each row of points in the array. After we have these n points, we treat them as control points and once again evaluate the Bezier point they form at a certain parameter. Therefore, with two parameters we can get coordinates for every point.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<b>Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.</b><br/>
		For each neighboring face, I used the next() and vertex() functions of the half-edge to get all the points around that face: p0, p1, and p2. To see how that face would contribute to the overall normal for the vertex, I calculated a normal vector by calculating the cross product between (p1 - p0) and (p2 - p1) and divided that value by half the magnitude of the normal vector (which is equal to the area). To iterate through each of the faces, I simply went to the current face’s twin’s next, and kept going until I returned to the origin halfedge I was on.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>

		<b>Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</b><br/>
		My main bug was that for a while, pressing F was deleting the mesh. It turns out I hadn’t realized I also need to set the “next” property of the halfedge. Once I did that, my code worked.



		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		<b>Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</b><br/>
		My process was very similar to flipEdge. I drew out the changes and then simply went through each object and wrote the necessary changes as code.

		<b>Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.</b><br/>
		Surprisingly, my code worked on the first try.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<b>Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.</b><br/>
		My algorithm is pretty simple, tracking with the algorithm discussed in the task description. 

		First, I went through every vertex and computed the newPosition. To get n, I just iterated the halfedges coming out of the vertex, and for each halfedge, I visited it’s twin’s vertex to sum the neighbors' positions.

		Next, I iterated through each edge and computed the new positions for the midpoints. A and B were quite simple to get (halfedge and halfedge twin’s vertex), and the opposing vertices could be gotten by getting the next’s next’s vertex for both the halfedge and its twin. 

		I then iterated through every edge, and if it was between two old vertices, split it. I then updated the newPosition of the vertex created by the split with the edge’s newPosition. I had one bug here, where I set the half of the old vertex that was created to new, causing a greater-than-expected number of new vertices and causing to many edges to be flipped. I fixed this by inspecting the code.

		I then iterated through every edge, and flipped the new edges (another bug, I was not checking to see if they were new earlier) that went between old and new edges. In this step, I also cleared the isNew flag of all edges.

		Finally, I iterated through every vertex, updating the positions with their newPosition value and clearing the isNew flag. 

		<b>Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</b><br/>
		Below, I've taken screenshots of various subdivided meshes (subdividing twice after the original mesh).

			This result clearly shows that loop subdivision works pretty well for smooth meshes. The new triangles appear to replicate the original mesh, but it truly seems like we've increased the quality. However, for simpler, sharper-edged shapes, the loop subdivision algorithm distorts the underlying shape. Most likely, this is also happening at a micro level in the larger meshes, but the "smoothing out" that loop subdivision does is actually intended behavior. <br/>
			I also attempted to also split triangles in the smaller shapes to see their effects. However, the often ended up either distorting the shape (if the splits were uneven), or almost accelerating the smoothing-out of the sharp edges. Below is this phenomenon for the icosahedron with uniformly split traingles.

		  <b>Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.</b><br/>
		  The example of the cube is replicated below to highlight the asymmetry:
		  <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

				  <img src="./images/6/cube2.png" width="400px"/>

				</td>
			  </tr>
		  </table>
		  This is likely due to the original cube not being symmetric. As can be seen in the picture, there's kind of a counter-clockwise lean for the edges on the side faces of the cube. Essentially, it isn't symmetric. This results in the splits and subdivisions also being asymmetric. Therefore, my idea was to make the original cube symmetric. This can be done very simply by splitting the edge at the center of each face. The results of subdiving this can be seen below. Clearly, it worked in making the cube symmetric. However, the tradeoff is there are a couple redundant triangles in the cube, which may cause problems if we, say, had thousands or even millions of cubes in our scene.
